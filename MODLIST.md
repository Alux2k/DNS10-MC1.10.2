# Requests

To make a request, please use the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/DNSTechpack/DNS10-MC1.10.2/issues) page. Please do not make a mod request if we already have it listed as added. Also, please try to avoid making multiple issues for the same mod.

# Considerations

**Bold** = These mods are very similar and therefore need further discussion before adding one (or multiple) of them.
